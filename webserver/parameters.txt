Types of parameters (Or types of data we can send with a request)

1. Path Parameters (Path Variable)
2. Query Parameters (Query Params, Request Params)
3. Request Body (Payload, hidden Data)

1. Path parameters: 
Suppose i want to send id and name with the request, and id and name would never be null.

localhost:8000/users/{id}/{name}
Postman: localhost:8000/users/5/janki

localhost:8000/books/vidhi/abhisha

Code: api.get("/users/:author/:publisher")
need to paas the parameter names in the path in Code

2. Query parameters:

Postman: localhost:8000/users?author=vidhi&publisher=abhisha

Here, we are already providing parameters name in the postman api call itself, 
so we don't need to paas the parameters names in the api path in code.
